## What Happens After You Submit an Issue?

1. Your issue is automatically labeled and organized
2. A developer (or AI coding agent) reviews the details
3. They implement the requested changes
4. The issue is updated with progress
5. You're notified when the work is complete

The detailed templates ensure that developers have all the information they need to implement your request without asking follow-up questions!
